Text Interface to Browsers

## License
Please see license.txt.

## Introduction
This tool attempts to present webpages as linear documents, with additional information provided on the status bar.
It is designed as a CLI application, and is designed to be as minimal as possible.

Support for Firefox will be added first, with plans to add Chrome in the future.

## background
A11Y is an abbreviation for accessibility.

Users of A11y Technology experience the following:
- complexity in browsing commonly used websites
- many instances of ARIA bugs
- problems with interfaces between screen readers, keyboards, and those using assistive technology

Those users need a way to:
- access the web as frictionlessly as their sighted companions
- view webpages consistently across platforms
- enable and disable A11Y controls and interactions on the fly
